Binary classification was performed on GSVA scores in Python (v3.8.2) using scikit-learn(0.24.1) to classify the most abnormal endotype [B-H] from the least abnormal endotype (A) using the molecular features. SMOTE was applied to account the class imbalance. 9 different classifiers were built on train data and evaluated the accuracy on test data. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's Kappa score. ROC and Precision-Recall curves were plotted using the Python library matplotlib (v3.3.4).
